## History of the Ensley Church of Christ
The **Ensley Church of Christ (ECOC)** was established in the 1930's by the late [Evangelist Marshall Keeble](https://www.jacksonst.org/marshall-keeble/) responsible for the rise of Black Churches of Christ in the South. 

Our congregation is one of the earliest African American Churches of Christ in Alabama *and the first African American Church of Christ in Birmingham*. ECOC is the seed for all African American Churches of Christ in Birmingham. We are a viable, progressive, and spiritual Birmingham 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. 

We are located at **1001 Dugan Avenue, Birmingham, AL 35214**


## Mission Statement of the Ensley Church of Christ
Here at the Ensley Church of Christ, our vision is to reach more people for Christ with **Luke 4:18** as our mission statement: 
*"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor: He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised."*
