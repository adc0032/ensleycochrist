### Nursing Home Ministry

The Ensley Church of Christ neighbors the [Birmingham Nursing and Rehab Center](https://birminghamnursingandrehab.com/). In 2024 a connection was fostered between members and management. The goal was to aid in the enrichment of the souls of residents. Join us every 1st & 3rd Sunday for singing and fellowship at 1:30PM. 

### Food Ministry!

We believe that food is a human right at the Ensley Church of Christ. We collect funds and grocery store gift cards to provide to families in need (typically during the holidays). If you would like to contribute or are in need, please reach out to us.
