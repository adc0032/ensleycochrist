### Nursing Home Ministry

The Ensley Church of Christ neighbors the [Birmingham Nursing and Rehab Center](https://birminghamnursingandrehab.com/). In 2024 a connection was fostered between members and management. The goal was to aid in the enrichment of the souls of residents. The ministry still in its early stages, continues to visit the residents and worship and praise the LORD regularly. With hopes of growing this Ministry, we have plans to visti more frequently and find ways to fellowship with these residents.
